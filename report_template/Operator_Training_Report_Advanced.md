## 2. PERFORMANCE METRICS

### 2.1 Productivity Metrics

#### Cycle Time Analysis

| Metric | Value | Benchmark | Performance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Average Cycle Time | [XX seconds] | [XX seconds] | [Above/Below] |
| Cycle Time Variance | [XX%] | [<15%] | [Status] |
| Fill Factor | [XX%] | [>85%] | [Status] |
| Volume Moved (m³/hr) | [XX m³/hr] | [Target] | [Status] |
| Fuel Efficiency | [L/m³] | [Target] | [Status] |

## 3. ADVANCED CONTROL ANALYTICS

### 3.1 Joystick Coordination Analysis

#### Control Smoothness Metrics

- RMS Velocity (Lower is smoother): [XX units - Target: <YY]
- RMS Acceleration: [XX units - Target: <YY]
- Jerk Analysis: [Number of sudden movements: XX]

#### Multi-Joystick Coordination

The Simultaneity Index (SI) Matrix shows how frequently different controls are used together. Higher values indicate better coordination between controls.

| Control Axis | Left X | Right X | Right Y |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Left Y | [0.XX] | [0.XX] | [0.XX] |

#### Bimanual Coordination Score (BCS)

Overall BCS: [0.XXX - Interpretation: Higher scores indicate better cross-hand coordination]

#### Simultaneous Control Usage Distribution

| Control Configuration | % of Active Time | Expert Benchmark |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Single Control (≥1) | [100%] | 100% |
| Dual Control (≥2) | [XX%] | >65% |
| Triple Control (≥3) | [XX%] | >35% |
| Full Control (4) | [XX%] | >10% |

Key Finding: [Interpretation of simultaneous control usage - e.g., 'Operator shows developing multi-control coordination with room for improvement in complex maneuvers']

### 3.2 Subcycle Performance Analysis

| Activity | Time | Efficiency | Smooth | Coord. | Grade |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Digging | [XX s] | [XX%] | [A-F] | [A-F] | [A-F] |
| Swinging | [XX s] | [XX%] | [A-F] | [A-F] | [A-F] |
| Dumping | [XX s] | [XX%] | [A-F] | [A-F] | [A-F] |

## 4. VISUAL ANALYTICS & INSIGHTS

### 4.1 Control Heatmaps

[Reference: Simultaneity Index Heatmap - see attached visualizations]

- High correlation zones indicate coordinated control movements
- Low correlation zones suggest opportunities for improved coordination

### 4.2 Video Analysis Snapshots

- [Timestamp XX:XX] - Critical error: Overextension during digging phase
- [Timestamp XX:XX] - Excellent execution: Smooth transition between swing and dump
- [Timestamp XX:XX] - Model trajectory overlay showing deviation from optimal path

## 5. AI-GENERATED INSIGHTS & RECOMMENDATIONS

### 5.1 Pattern Recognition Analysis

- Control Pattern: [AI identified tendency to under-utilize left joystick during complex maneuvers]
- Timing Pattern: [Consistent delay observed between dig completion and swing initiation]
- Efficiency Pattern: [Fill factor decreases after extended operation periods - possible fatigue indicator]

### 5.2 Personalized Training Recommendations

- Focus on Multi-Joystick Coordination: Practice exercises emphasizing simultaneous control usage, particularly left-right coordination
- Smoothness Training: Implement progressive speed drills starting at 50% speed to improve control smoothness
- Precision Placement Exercises: Target-based dumping exercises to improve placement accuracy
