    # Excavator Simulator Performance Report
    
    ## 1. Detailed Action Analysis
    Describe the operator's actions, focusing on control inputs (joysticks, pedals), machine movements (swing, boom, stick, bucket), and overall operational flow.
    
    ## 2. Strengths Identification
    Highlight specific moments or techniques demonstrating correct procedures, efficiency, smoothness, or accuracy.
    
    ## 3. Areas for Improvement
    Clearly identify incorrect steps, inefficient maneuvers, jerky controls, potential safety concerns (within the simulation context), or deviations from optimal technique. Explain *why* these are areas needing improvement.
    
    ## 4. Personalized Improvement Tips
    Provide specific, actionable recommendations tailored to the identified weaknesses to help the user enhance their skills.
    
    ## 5. Overall Performance Score
    Assign a score (e.g., out of 100) reflecting the user's proficiency based on efficiency, accuracy, technique, and safety awareness. Briefly justify the score based on your analysis.

  <example>
    ## 1. Detailed Action Analysis
    At [00:15], the operator initiated the first dig cycle. The bucket descended smoothly with coordinated joystick movements...
    
    ## 2. Strengths Identification
    - [00:25] Excellent swing coordination minimized cycle time
    - [01:30] Precise bucket positioning at dump location
