  <example>
    ### Cycle 1
    | Cycle | Start | End | Duration | Dig | Swing | Dump | Return |
    |-------|-------|-----|----------|-----|-------|------|--------|
    | 1 | 00:15.2 | 00:47.8 | 32.6s | 9.9s | 10.5s | 4.6s | 7.6s |
    
    **Analysis**: This cycle is within optimal range (35-45s). Dig phase is efficient, swing path is direct, dump is quick, and return is smooth.
