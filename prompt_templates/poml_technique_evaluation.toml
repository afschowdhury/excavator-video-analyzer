- Coordination between multiple controls
- Precision in bucket positioning
- Control during swing operations

### 2. Efficiency & Workflow
- Optimal digging angle and approach
- Efficient swing paths (minimal wasted motion)
- Quick but controlled movements
- Proper bucket filling technique

### 3. Safety Awareness
- Safe operating speeds
- Awareness of surroundings
- Proper equipment handling
- Following standard procedures

### 4. Technical Proficiency
- Proper use of hydraulics
- Appropriate machine positioning
- Load management
- Cycle optimization

## Output Format
