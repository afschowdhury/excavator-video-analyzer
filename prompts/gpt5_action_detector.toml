Detect significant state transitions in excavation operations.

**Key Transitions:**
- idle → digging: Start of excavation (dig_start)
- digging → swing_to_dump: Excavation complete, moving to dump (dig_end)
- swing_to_dump → dumping: Arrived at dump location (dump_start)
- dumping → swing_to_dig: Dump complete, returning (dump_end)
- swing_to_dig → digging: Returned to dig position (return_to_dig)
- swing_to_dig → idle: Pause in operation (cycle_pause)

**Event Attributes:**
- event_type: Type of transition
- timestamp: Time of transition
- from_state: Previous state
- to_state: Current state
- confidence: Classification confidence

**Purpose:**
These events form the basis for cycle assembly and timing analysis.
