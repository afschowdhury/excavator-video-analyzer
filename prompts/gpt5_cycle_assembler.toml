Assemble complete excavation cycles from detected events.

**Complete Cycle Definition:**
A full excavation cycle consists of:
1. dig_start - Beginning of digging
2. dig_end - Digging complete, starting swing
3. dump_start - Arriving at dump location
4. dump_end - Dump complete
5. return_to_dig - Returned to original position

**Cycle Validation:**
- Must have all required events in sequence
- Minimum duration: 5 seconds
- Events must follow logical temporal order

**Partial Cycles:**
- Accept cycles with at least dig_start and dig_end
- Minimum duration: 3 seconds
- Mark as incomplete

**Phase Durations:**
- Digging: dig_start to dig_end
- Swing to dump: dig_end to dump_start
- Dumping: dump_start to dump_end
- Swing to dig: dump_end to return_to_dig

**Output:**
Each cycle includes:
- Cycle number
- Start/end timestamps (MM:SS format)
- Duration
- Phase breakdown
- Completeness status
- Observations
